# Roadmap

## Phase 1 (Complete)
- Local semantic recall
- Context detection
- Rule-based error remediation
- Community moat seeding
- Basic predictive intent (beta)

## Phase 2 (In Progress)
- Refinement of ranking weights (documented adjustments)
- Expanded rule patterns for common CI/CD and container issues
- Configuration surface (enable/disable context, tuning weights)
- Deterministic export/import utilities

## Phase 3 (Planned)
- LLM remediation augmentation (opt-in)
- Natural language recall / composition
- Organization scoped moat sync
- Plugin architecture for custom rules and ranking signals

## Phase 4 (Exploration)
- Incremental learning from accepted suggestions (local only)
- Structured error taxonomy generation
- Graph relationships between commands and contexts

## Principles During Expansion
- Deterministic clarity before probabilistic layering
- No silent remote calls
- Auditability of suggestions (source attribution)
